In order to provide the MyKiddyTracker Service, MyKiddyTracker will periodically access your address book or contact list on your mobile phone to locate the mobile phone numbers of other MyKiddyTracker users (“in-network” numbers), or otherwise categorize other mobile phone numbers as “out-network” numbers, which are stored as one-way irreversibly hashed values.\n \n</p> <br><b>Cookies Information: \n</b></br> <p>When you visit the MyKiddyTracker Site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. MyKiddyTracker uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser, your phone number, phone number you are requesting the Communication of and various Communication information. When you use the MyKiddyTracker Service, our servers log certain general information that our application sends whenever a message is sent or received, or if you update or request any Communication information, including time and date stamps and the mobile phone numbers the messages were sent from and to. \n \n</p> <br><b>The Information MyKiddyTracker Does Not Collect\n</b></br> \t <p> MyKiddyTracker does not collect names, addresses or other contact information from its users’ mobile address book or contact lists other than mobile phone numbers and emails. The MyKiddyTracker mobile application will associate whatever name the MyKiddyTracker user has assigned to the mobile telephone number in his/her mobile address book or contact list — and this occurs dynamically on the mobile device itself and not on MyKiddyTracker’s servers and is not transmitted to MyKiddyTracker. This means that if you have your friend’s mobile phone number associated with the name “Ranjan” in your mobile address book, that’s the name that will appear for that mobile phone number in your MyKiddyTracker contact list. We do not collect location data, but users may voluntarily share their location with other users via the MyKiddyTracker Service.  \n \n</p> \tThe contents of messages that have been delivered by the MyKiddyTracker Service are not copied, kept or archived by MyKiddyTracker in the normal course of business. The MyKiddyTracker Service is meant to be a SMS replacement, using data service through a user’s phone (either via cell network or wifi). Users type their messages, which are sent via data service to our servers, and routed to the intended recipient (who must also be a MyKiddyTracker user), if that recipient is online. If the recipient is not online, the undelivered message is held in MyKiddyTracker’s server until it can be delivered. If the message is undelivered for fifteen (15) days, the undelivered message is deleted from our servers. Once a message has been delivered, it may no longer resides on our servers. The contents of any delivered messages may not kept or retained by MyKiddyTracker — the only records of the content of any delivered messages reside directly on the sender’s and recipients mobile devices (and which may be deleted at the user’s option). Notwithstanding the above, MyKiddyTracker may retain date and time stamp information associated with successfully delivered messages and the mobile phone numbers involved in the messages, as well as any other information which MyKiddyTracker is legally compelled to collect. Files that are sent through the MyKiddyTracker Service will reside on our servers after delivery for a short period of time, but are deleted and stripped of any identifiable information within a short period of time in accordance with our general retention policies. \n \n <b>The Way MyKiddyTracker Uses Information</b> \n
    \t If you submit Personally Identifiable Information to us through the MyKiddyTracker Site, or MyKiddyTracker Service, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the MyKiddyTracker Site and MyKiddyTracker Service.

Users type their messages, which are sent via data service to our servers, and routed to the intended recipient (who must also be a PrimesysTrack user), if that recipient is online. If the recipient is not online, the undelivered message is held in PrimesysTrack’s server until it can be delivered.

Notwithstanding the above, PrimesysTrack may retain date and time stamp information associated with successfully delivered messages and the mobile phone numbers involved in the messages, as well as any other information which PrimesysTrack is legally compelled to collect. Files that are sent through the PrimesysTrack Service will reside on our servers after delivery for a short period of time, but are deleted and stripped of any identifiable information within a short period of time in accordance with our general retention policies. \n \n <b>The Way PrimesysTrack Uses Information</b> \n
    \t If you submit Personally Identifiable Information to us through the PrimesysTrack Site, or PrimesysTrack Service, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the PrimesysTrack Site and PrimesysTrack Service. In particular, your mobile phone number is essential to your use of the PrimesysTrack Service and will be retained. Any billing information that may be collected from you may get deleted thirty (30) days after the termination of your account with PrimesysTrack. Any Personally Identifiable Information or Communication content that you voluntarily disclose on the PrimesysTrack Service becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by other users of the PrimesysTrack Service (unless such user is blocked by you). Your name (as it is saved in other user\'s mobile phone address book or contact list) may be displayed to other users when you update your Communication messages through the PrimesysTrack Service and other users may contact you through the PrimesysTrack Service. We do not use your mobile phone number or other Personally Identifiable Information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your mobile phone number (or email address, if provided) without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major PrimesysTracks Site or PrimesysTrack Service changes or for customer service purposes). We may use both your Personally Identifiable Information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the PrimesysTrack Site and PrimesysTrack Service and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends. We may use cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the PrimesysTrack Service or PrimesysTrack Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; monitor individual and aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (d) track your entries, submissions, views and such.\n \n <b>When PrimesysTrack Discloses Information</b> \n
    \t Other users of the PrimesysTrack Service may see your Communication Submissions in a way that is consistent with the use of the PrimesysTrack Service. In other words: If another user has your mobile phone number stored in their mobile phone address book or contact list, they will be able see your Communication information unless you have chosen to block such user. “Last Seen” information is available and displayed to each user who has your mobile phone number in their mobile phone address book or contact book (and which you have not blocked), and reflects the last approximate time the PrimesysTrack mobile application has been used or brought to the foreground on your mobile phone. “Last Seen” information is reported to PrimesysTrack when a user brings the mobile application to the foreground.\n
    \t We do not sell or share your Personally Identifiable Information (such as mobile phone number) with other third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third party service providers to the extent that it is reasonably necessary to perform, improve or maintain the PrimesysTrack Service. We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, asset views, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the PrimesysTrack Site. We may collect and release Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with Indianlaws (such as India Copyright Law), international law or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant or equivalent, or where in our reasonable belief, an individual’s physical safety may be at risk or threatened. PrimesysTrack also reserves the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that PrimesysTrack believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the PrimesysTrack Site or our servers, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of PrimesysTrack, our users or others. \n \n <b>What Choices you can make\n</b> \t   You may, of course, decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information through the PrimesysTrack Site or the PrimesysTrack Service, in which case PrimesysTrack may not be able to provide certain services to you.
